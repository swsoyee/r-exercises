Visualization is a key component to understanding and communicating your understanding to an audience. The more second nature turning your data into plots becomes, the more you can focus on the overall goals instead of being stuck on technical details.  

As a freelance data analyst, I know that often times between when a project arrives at your table until it needs to be delivered is shorter than you would like, leaving limited time to consult documentation and search [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).  

This exercise set is a drilling exercise for the advanced user, but can be completed by a novice with patience and willingness to learn.  

Solutions are available [here](https://www.r-exercises.com/2018/02/08/ggplot-drilling-exercises-solutions/).  

## Exercise 1

Load the `ggplot2`, `MASS` and `viridis` packages. Combine the three [Pima](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Pima.tr.html) data-sets from (MASS) (used in the previous [exercise set](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/10/30/logistic-regression-in-r/)) and make a 2D density (density heat map) plot of `bp` versus `bmi` using `scale_fill_viridis()`.

```{r exercise-1, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(viridis)
library(data.table)

head(Pima.te)
head(Pima.tr)
head(Pima.tr2)
df <- rbind(Pima.te, Pima.tr, Pima.tr2)
setDT(df)
df

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = bp, y = bmi)) +
  stat_density_2d(geom = "raster", aes(fill = stat(density)), contour = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)
```

## Exercise 2  

Using the same data, overlay a histogram of `bmi` with a normal density curve using the sample mean and standard deviation.  

```{r exercise-2, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 60) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean(df$bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
                            sd = sd(df$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)),
                lwd = 1,
                col = 'red') +
  expand_limits(x = 0)
```

## Exercise 3

Using the `accdeaths` data-set from `MASS`, make a line plot with time on the x-axis. Mark the maximum and minimum value of accidental deaths in a month with a read and blue dot, respectively. Note that the data does not come in ggplot-friendly format.  

```{r exercise-3, message=FALSE}
accd <- data.frame(deaths = as.matrix(accdeaths),
                   year = as.numeric(time(accdeaths)))
head(accd)
ggplot(accd, aes(x = year, y = deaths)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = accd[which.min(accd$deaths),],
             col = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = accd[which.max(accd$deaths),],
             col = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_text(data = accd[which.max(accd$deaths),],
            aes(label = deaths), vjust = 2.2) +
  geom_text(data = accd[which.min(accd$deaths),],
            aes(label = deaths), vjust = -2.2) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 4  

The internet surely loves cats, but most users have little idea how much a catâ€™s organs weigh. Using the `cats` data from the `MASS` package, make two 2D density plot of total weight versus hearth weight, side by side; one for each gender. In addition, add a dot for each observation.  

```{r exercise-4, message=FALSE}
head(cats)
ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Bwt, y = Hwt)) +
  stat_density2d(geom = "raster", aes(fill = stat(density)), contour = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(.~ Sex) +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +
  geom_point(shape = '.', col = 'white') +
  labs(y = "Heart Weigth (g)", x = "Body Weight (kg)",
       title = "Body Weight versus hearth weight (by gender)")
```

## Exercise 5  

Back to the pima data. Make a boxplot for the `glu` (glucose concentration), splitting the observations into five age groups with approximately the same number of observations.  

```{r exercise-5, message=FALSE}
table(cut_number(df$age, 5))
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = glu)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_number(age, 5)))
```

## Exercise 6

Using `ggplot2`'s inbuilt `economics` data-set, make a stacked bar plot with proportions of unemployed to employed (employed or not seeking work) with the date in the x-axis.  

```{r exercise-6, message=FALSE}
head(economics)
eco_data <- economics
setDT(eco_data)
eco_data[, `:=`(Punemploy = unemploy / pop, Pemploy = (pop - unemploy) / pop)]

ggplot(melt(eco_data, id.vars = "date", measure.vars = c("Punemploy", "Pemploy")), 
       aes(x = date)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = value, fill = variable), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(y = "Percent", x = "Date", main = "Proportions of unemployed to employed")
```

## Exercise 7  

Using `ggplot2`'s inbuilt `msleep` data-set, make a scatter plot (body weight versus total sleep) of all animals of the order artiodactyla. Mark the domesticated animals with a different color (from black) and annotate their names onto the graph.  

```{r exercise-7, message=FALSE}
ms <- msleep
setDT(ms)
subdt <- ms[, group := ifelse(conservation == "domesticated", "Domes", "None")][order == "Artiodactyla"]
ggplot(data = subdt, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(data = subdt[group == "Domes"], aes(label = name), vjust = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Body weight vs. Total sleep time of Artiodactyla",
       x = "Body weight (kg)",
       y = "Total sleep time (hour)") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 8  

Using `msleep`, make one density plot for the total sleep, colored by `vore`. Play with the transparency and parameters of the density estimation.  

```{r exercise-8, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = msleep, aes(x = sleep_total, fill = vore)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3, n = 25) +
  labs(title = "Density plot for the total sleep",
       y = "Density",
       x = "Total sleep time (hour)") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 9

Using the Gapminder data, (available from the `gapminder` package) and data from the `rworldmap` package, color countries by life expectancy in 2007. Use the `geom_map`.

```{r exercise-9, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(rworldmap)
gap <- gapminder
setDT(gap)

country <- unique(gap$country)
region <- unique(map_data(map = "world")$region)

# Modify country name
gap$country <- as.character(gap$country)
country[!country %in% region]
# region[grepl(pattern = "Congo", x = region)]
gap[gap$country == "Congo, Dem. Rep.", ]$country <- "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
gap[gap$country == "Congo, Rep.", ]$country <- "Republic of Congo"
gap[gap$country == "United States", ]$country <- "USA"
gap[gap$country == "United Kingdom", ]$country <- "UK"
gap[gap$country == "Korea, Rep.", ]$country <- "South Korea"
gap[gap$country == "Korea, Dem. Rep.", ]$country <- "North Korea"
gap[gap$country == "Slovak Republic", ]$country <- "Slovakia"
gap[gap$country == "Yemen, Rep.", ]$country <- "Yemen"

data <- merge(x = gap[year == 2007,],
              y = map_data(map = "world"), 
              by.x = "country",
              by.y = "region",
              all = TRUE)
ggplot(data = data) +
  geom_map(map = map_data(map = "world"), aes(map_id = country, x = long, y = lat, fill = lifeExp)) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 10

Still using the Gapminder data, make a scatter plot with the GDP per capital on a log scale on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis. Map population to size and color to continent. Write a loop that makes a graph for each year and saves it with `ggsave` to your hard drive, so later you can turn it into an animated graph.  

```{r exercise-10, message=FALSE}
# Failed on installation of `gganimate` package.
gap <- gapminder
setDT(gap)

ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, color = continent)) +
  labs(x = "log(GDP per capital)", y = "Life expectancy", title = "Life expectancy vs. GDP") +
  theme_bw()
```
