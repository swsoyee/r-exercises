This exercise set provides practice using the fast and concise data.table package. If you are new to the syntax it is recommended that you start by solving [the set on the basics of data.table](http://www.r-exercises.com/2017/08/23/basics-of-data-table-smooth-data-exploration/) before attempting this one.  

We will use data on used cars (Toyota Corollas) on sale during 2004 in the Netherlands. There are 1436 observations with information on the price at which it is offered for sale, age, mileage and more, see full variable description [here](http://www.r-exercises.com/2017/08/31/data-description-for-exercise-beyond-the-basics-of-data-table-smooth-data-exploration).  

Answers are available [here](http://www.r-exercises.com/2017/09/06/beyond-the-basics-of-data-table-smooth-data-exploration-solutions).  

## Exercise 1

Load the [data](http://www.r-exercises.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/toy_cor.csv) available to your working environment using `fread()`, don’t forget to load the `data.table` package first.  

```{r exercise-1, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)

df <- fread("http://www.r-exercises.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/toy_cor.csv")
df
```

## Exercise 2

Using one line of code print out the most common car model in the data, and the number of times it appears.  

```{r exercise-2}
df[, .N, by = Model][order(-N)][1]
```

## Exercise 3

Print out the mean and median price of the 10 most common models.  

```{r exercise-3}
df[, .(.N, 
       meanPrice = mean(Price), 
       medianPrice = median(Price)
       ), by = Model][order(-N)][1:10]
```

## Exercise 4

Delete all columns that have `Guarantee` in its name.  
 
```{r exercise-4, message=FALSE}
names(df)
df[, grep(pattern = "Guarantee", names(df)) := NULL]
names(df)
```

## Exercise 5

Add a new column which is the squared deviation of `price` from the average `price` of cars the same `color`.  
 
```{r exercise-5}
df[, sq_dev_by_colorl := (Price - mean(Price))^2,  by = Color]
df
```

## Exercise 6

Use a combintation of `.SDcols` and `lapply` to get the `mean` value of columns `18` through `35`.    
 
```{r exercise-6}
df[, lapply(.SD, mean), .SDcols = 18:35]
```

## Exercise 7

Print the most common `color` by `age` in years?  

```{r exercise-7}
df[, (.N), by = .(Years = floor(Age_08_04/12), Color)][order(Years, V1), .SD[.N], by = Years]
```

## Exercise 8

For the dummy variables in columns `18:35` recode `0` to `-1`. You might want to use the `set` function here.  

```{r exercise-8}
df
# df[, lapply(.SD, function(x) replace(x, which(x == 0), -1)), .SDcols = 18:35]

for (j in 18:35) {
  set(df,
      i = df[, which(.SD == 0), .SDcols = j],
      j = j,
      value = -1)
}
df
```


## Exercise 9

Use the `set` function to add “yuck!” to the varible `Fuel_Type` if it is not `Petrol`. Just because…  

```{r exercise-9}
# df[, lapply(.SD, function(x) replace(x, which(x != "Petrol"), "yuck!")), .SDcol = "Fuel_Type"]

set(df,
    i =  df[, which(Fuel_Type == "Petrol")],
    j = "Fuel_Type",
    value = "Petrol yuck!")
```

## Exercise 10

Using `.SDcols` and one command create two new variables, `log` of `Weight` and `Price`.  

```{r exercise-10}
df[, (c("logWeight", "logPrice")) := lapply(.SD, log), .SDcols = c("Weight", "Price")]
df
```
