LOADING AND PLOTTING THE DATA (Part 1)  

Working with hydro-meteorological data can be very time consuming and exhausting. Luckily, R can provide a framework to easily import and process data in order to implement statistical analysis and models. In these tutorials, we are going to explore and analyze data from a tropical basin in order to create a simple forecast model.
Let’s have a look at these exercises and examples.  

Answers to these exercises are available [here](http://r-exercises.com/2018/02/27/r-for-hydrologists-loading-and-plotting-the-data-part-1-solution/).  

## Exercise 1

First, let’s import the daily levels of a river and the rainfall data from the basin, stored in a CSV file. Please download the data [here](https://www.r-exercises.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PAICOL.csv) (PAICOL.csv) and import it with the function `read.csv`.  
Then, assign it to `river_data`.  

Remember that river_data is a data frame, so we can access the attributes of it with \$; for example, you can get the date values with `river_data$DATE`.  

```{r exercise-1, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
river_data <- read.csv("https://www.r-exercises.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PAICOL.csv")
setDT(river_data)
head(river_data)
```

## Exercise 2  

To guarantee that the `DATE` column has the proper format, it is crucial to convert the string values into dates with the function `as.Date`. Please replace the value of DATE with formatted dates.  

```{r exercise-2, message=FALSE}
sapply(river_data, class)
river_data$DATE <- as.Date(river_data$DATE)
sapply(river_data, class)
```

## Exercise 3

Create a summary of the river_data.  

```{r exercise-3, message=FALSE}
summary(river_data)
```

## Exercise 4  

Normally we can use the build in R functions; but, this time, we will use the `ggplot` package. In my opinion, it is able to create better plots. Before we start, install it and load it to be able to use it.  
```
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```
Create a line plot of the `LEVEL` with the `ggplot` function.  

```{r exercise-4, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = river_data, aes(x = DATE, y = LEVEL)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Daily levels of a river") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 5  

Create a scatter plot of the `RAIN` against `LEVEL`.  

```{r exercise-5, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = river_data, aes(x = RAIN, y = LEVEL)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of RAIN and LEVEL") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 6

Create a plot of the `RAIN` and `LEVEL`.  

```{r exercise-6, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = river_data, aes(x = DATE, y = LEVEL)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = "LEVEL")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = DATE, y = RAIN, color = "RAIN")) + 
  labs(title = "Daily levels & rainfall of a river") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 7  

Find and plot circles on the `LEVEL` plot at the maximum and minimum value.  

```{r exercise-7, message=FALSE}
data_max <- river_data[which.max(river_data$LEVEL), ]
data_min <- river_data[which.min(river_data$LEVEL), ]

ggplot(data = river_data, aes(x = DATE, y = LEVEL)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(x = data_max$DATE, y = data_max$LEVEL), shape = 1, size = 3, color = "red") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = data_min$DATE, y = data_min$LEVEL), shape = 1, size = 3, color = "blue") + 
  scale_shape_discrete(solid = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Daily levels of a river") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 8  

Plot the `LEVEL` for the year "2001".  

```{r exercise-8, message=FALSE}
ggplot(river_data[DATE %between% c("2001-01-01", "2001-12-31")], aes(x = DATE, y = LEVEL)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Daily levels of a river in 2001") +
  theme_bw()
```
