A generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of an ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution.  
The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function. It also allows the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.  

GLMs can be split into three groups:  
- **Poisson Regression –** for count data with no over/under dispersion issues.
- **Quasi-Poisson** or **Negative Binomial Models –** where the models are over-dispersed.
- **Logistic Regression Models –** where the response data is binary (ex. present or absent, male or female, or proportional (ex. percentages.))

In this exercise, we will focus on GLM’s that use Poisson regression. Please download the data-set for this exercise [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/etklzom23d31edo/gotelli.csv?dl=0). The data-set investigates the biographical determinants of species richness at a regional scale (Gotelli and Everson, 2002). The main purpose of this exercise is to replicate the Poisson regression of an ant species richness against latitude, elevation and habitat type on their paper.  

Answers to these exercises are available [here](https://www.r-exercises.com/2018/07/19/basic-generalised-linear-modelling-part-1-solutions/). If you obtained a different (correct) answer than those listed on the solutions page, please feel free to post your answer as a comment on that page. Load the data-set and required package before running the exercise.  

## Exercise 1

Load the data and check the data structure using the scatterplotMatrix function. Assess its co-variation and data patterning.

```{r exercise-1, message=FALSE}
library(MuMIn)
library(data.table)
library(car)
library(forcats)
dt <- fread("https://www.dropbox.com/s/etklzom23d31edo/gotelli.csv?dl=1")
dt$Site <- as.factor(dt$Site)
dt$Habitat <- as.factor(dt$Habitat)

scatterplotMatrix(dt)
```

## Exercise 2  

Run a GLM model and run VIF analysis to check for inflation. Pay attention to the col-linearity.  

```{r exercise-2, message=FALSE}
# Check distribution of Y (Srich) 
hist(dt$Srich)

model.glm <- glm(Srich ~ Habitat + Latitude + Elevation,
                 family = poisson(), 
                 data  = dt)
summary(model.glm)
step(model.glm)
vif(model.glm)
```

## Exercise 3

Actually, you change your mind. There is no permanent human population on Antarctica. Drop this (unused) level from your factor.  

```{r exercise-3, message=FALSE}
# Method 1
# gp$continent <- droplevels(gp$continent)
# Method 2
# gp$continent <- factor(gp$continent)
# Method 3
# gp$continent  <- gp$continent[, drop = TRUE]
# forcats Method
gp$continent <- fct_drop(gp$continent)
fct_count(gp$continent)
```

## Exercise 4  

Again, modify the continent factor, making it more precise. Add two new levels: instead of Americas, add North America and South America. The countries in the following vector should be classified as South America and the rest as North America.

```
c("Argentina", "Bolivia", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", "Ecuador",
"Paraguay", "Peru", "Uruguay", "Venezuela")
```

```{r exercise-4, message=FALSE}
gp$continent <- fct_expand(gp$continent, "South America", "North America")
sAmerica <- c("Argentina", "Bolivia", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", "Ecuador",
"Paraguay", "Peru", "Uruguay", "Venezuela")

gp$continent[gp$country %in% sAmerica] <- "South America"
gp$continent[gp$continent == "Americas"] <- "North America"

gp$continent <- fct_drop(gp$continent)
fct_count(gp$continent)
```

## Exercise 5  

Arrange the levels of the continent factor in alphabetical order.  

```{r exercise-5, message=FALSE}
# Method 1
# levels(gp$continent)
# gp$continent <- factor(gp$continent, levels = sort(levels(gp$continent)))
# levels(gp$continent)
# forcats Method
gp$continent <- fct_relevel(gp$continent, sort(levels(gp$continent)))
fct_count(gp$continent)
```

## Exercise 6

Re-order the continent levels again so that they appear in order of total population in 2007.  

```{r exercise-6, message=FALSE}
gp$continent <- fct_relevel(gp$continent, 
                            levels(gp[year == 2007,                         
                                      sum(as.numeric(pop)), 
                                      by = continent][order(-V1)]$continent
                                   )
                            )
fct_count(gp$continent)
```

## Exercise 7  

Reverse the order of the factors.  

```{r exercise-7, message=FALSE}
gp$continent <- fct_rev(gp$continent)
fct_count(gp$continent)
```

## Exercise 8  

Make continents, again, an un-ordered factor. Set North America as the first level, therefore interpreted as a reference group in modeling functions such as `lm()`.  

```{r exercise-8, message=FALSE}
gp$continent <- fct_relevel(gp$continent, "North America")
```

## Exercise 9  

Turn the following messy vector into a factor with two levels: “Female” and “Male” using the factor function. Use the labels argument in the `factor()` function.  
```
gender <- c("f", "m ", "male ","male", "female", "FEMALE", "Male", "f", "m")  
```
```{r exercise-9, message=FALSE}
# Method 1
# gender <- c("f", "m ", "male ","male", "female", "FEMALE", "Male", "f", "m")
# g <- tolower(substr(gender, 1, 1))
# g <- as.factor(ifelse(g == "f", "Female", "Male"))

# forcats Method 
gender <- c("f", "m ", "male ","male", "female", "FEMALE", "Male", "f", "m")
gender <- as_factor(gender)
gender <- fct_collapse(
  gender,
  Female = c("f", "female", "FEMALE"),
  Male   = c("m ", "m", "male ", "male", "Male")
)
fct_count(gender)
```

## Exercise 10  

Gender can be considered sensitive data. Convert the gender variable into a factor that takes the integer values “1” and “2”, where one integer represents female and the other male, but make the choice randomly.  

```{r exercise-10, message=FALSE}
# Method 1
# choice <- c(1,2)
# Gender Male
# g1 <- sample(choice, 1, replace = TRUE)
# Gender Female
# g2 <- choice[!g1 == choice]
# factor(ifelse(gender == "Male", g1, g2))

# forcats Method 
gender <- fct_anon(gender)
fct_count(gender)
```
