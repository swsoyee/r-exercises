## INTRODUCTION  

R Markdown is one of the most popular data science tools and is used to save and execute code, create exceptional reports whice are easily shareable.  

The documents that R Markdown provides are fully reproducible and support a wide variety of static and dynamic output formats.  

Using markdown syntax, which provides an easy way of creating documents that can be converted to many other file types, while embeding R code in the report, so it is not necessary to keep the report and R script separately. Furthermore The report is written as normal text, so knowledge of HTML is not required. Of course no additional files are needed because everything is incorporated in the HTML file.
